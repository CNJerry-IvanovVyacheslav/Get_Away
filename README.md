# Jetpack Compose Turn-Based Grid Game

### A small turn-based strategy game built in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**.

## **Features:**

* 6x6 grid with player and enemy characters.

* Player moves 1 cell per turn; enemy moves 2 cells.

* Traps freeze the enemy or eliminate the player.

* Walls block movement â€” strategic gameplay.

* Exit tile = player wins.

* Swipe gestures for intuitive player control.

* Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation) with MVVM.

* Reactive state management using Kotlin Flow.

## **Purpose:**
This project demonstrates **Jetpack Compose for dynamic UI rendering, gesture handling**, and building **state-driven games** in a clean, maintainable architecture.

**Future improvements**: animations, multiple levels, smarter enemy AI.

*(The game is inspired by the "Wappo Game" and is made solely to explore a technology that is new to me)*
